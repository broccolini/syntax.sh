Blocks in JavaScript can be created arbitrarily by containing code in braces.
All blocks contain their own [scope](#scope).

    {
        var one = 1;
        var two = 2;
    }

They are most often used in conjunction with [control flow](#control_flow) structures.

    if (x == 1) {
        console.log("x is 1");
    }
