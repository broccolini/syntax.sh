Statements are separated by semicolons.

    var one = 1;
    var two = 2;

Whitespace can be freely used to format code. It does not affect how the code
is interpreted.

    var one = 1; var two = 2;

**Note:** A controversial aspect of JavaScriptâ€™s syntax is
[automatic semicolon insertion](http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons).
It is possible to omit semicolons in many cases, however this can be confusing
for newcomers from other C-style languages.
