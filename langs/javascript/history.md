JavaScript was designed by [Brendan Eich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich).
It first appeared in 1995 as the scripting language for Netscape Navigator 2.0.
It was originally named “LiveScript,” but it was renamed “JavaScript” to
piggyback off of Java’s popularity at the time. Other than being similar in
syntax, Java and JavaScript are unrelated.
