Python was created in 1989 by [Guido van Rossum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).
It was designed to be a fun-to-use, object oriented language. As such, Python
owes its name to British comedy troupe Monty Python.

Python is a language backed by a strong minimalist philosophy, summarized in
[The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). Its practicioners
are encouraged to stick to common patterns and idioms, creating _pythonic_ code
that reflects Pythonâ€™s sense of minimalism.

It is often used as a primary language for computer science programs at
universities due to its emphasis on explicitness and readability.
