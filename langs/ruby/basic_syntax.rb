    # Ruby features an especially flexible syntax.
    # Readability was a major influence on its design.

    # Single-line comments begin with #

    =begin
       Block comments can be done like this, but the
       # style is more common.
    =end

    # Statements are separated by line breaks.
    one = 1
    two = 2

    # Statements can also be separated by semicolons. This is
    # less common, but comes in handy.
    one = 1; two = 2;
