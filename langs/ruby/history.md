Ruby was designed in 1993 by [Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto).
It was first released in 1995. Matz named the language “Ruby” because it was the
birthstone of one of his colleagues.

Matz has said about Ruby, “I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world
to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary
purpose of Ruby language.”
