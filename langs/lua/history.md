Lua was created in 1993 by [Roberto Ierusalimschy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Ierusalimschy),
Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes. The trio created Lua as members
of [PUC-Rio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Catholic_University_of_Rio_de_Janeiro)’s Tecgraf group.

Lua’s country of origin is Brazil. At the time, Brazil had trade barriers
preventing the import of hardware and software. Tecgraf, unable to leverage
third-party software, had to create its own tools from scratch. They named the
language Lua, Portuguese for moon, because it was an iteration upon their
internal configuration language SOL, Portuguese for sun.
