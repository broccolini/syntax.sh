Lua is most commonly used as an embedded scripting language for other
applications, especially for games. Its C API, liblua, is relatively easy to
implement in host applications. The language itself has a short learning curve
and is very flexible.

It has been used as the scripting language for World of Warcraft, Redis, Nginx,
and many other applications.
