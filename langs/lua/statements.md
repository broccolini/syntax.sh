    -- Statements are almost always separated by line breaks.
    local one = 1
    local two = 2

    -- In some cases the line break may be omitted, usually
    -- only when a keyword makes it possible. For example, this
    if one == 1 then
        return
    end

    -- Can be shortened to
    if one == 1 then return end
