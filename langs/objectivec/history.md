Objective-C began its life in 1981 by [Brad Cox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Cox)
and Tom Love at their company Stepstone. It was first published in distributed
in 1986. The pair wanted to combine the reusability patterns of Smalltalk with
the ubiquity of C.

In 1988, NeXT licensed Objective-C from Stepstone. NeXT extended the
[GNU Compiler Collection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection)
to support Objective-C and created frameworks upon which [NeXTstep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTstep)
applications were built. Apple acquired NeXT in 1996 and leveraged NeXTâ€™s trove
of Objective-C resources to develop Mac OS X, and later iOS.
