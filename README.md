syntax.sh
=========

An idea for a cross-language "cheat sheet" sort of reference guide. Like Google Translate for code (except
you have to rewrite the code yourself)!

The idea is to show the same example in each different language for every topic. It's meant to be a resource
for people jumping from one language to another. It is not meant to explain concepts in depth.
